# fabula-ultima-initiative
Fabula Ultima initiative tracker tool for Foundry VTT

This is a standalone modification of the temporary combatant initiative from [Combat Utility Belt](https://github.com/death-save/combat-utility-belt). This has been tested on Foundry V10 Build 291.

Once enabled, you should see the "Configure Initiative" button below all of the turns in your encounter.

When you click it, you'll get a form to input the key values.

It will automatically populate the encounter with the correct number of alternating PC and NPC turns starting with the winning side.
